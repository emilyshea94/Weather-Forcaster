# Weather-Forcaster


## Descriptiom 
For this challenge I was tasked with creaing a functioning weather app with help from third-party APIs.
I first ran into issues with API's when I started this challenge so I scraped my orignal code and started over with my current knowledge of code.
This weather app allows the user to type in a city and then see the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV Index.
The user is also able to see the forecast for the next 5 days.

## Usage
When the user enters the name of a city into the search bar then *clicks* the "magnifying glass", they are then presented with the weather forcast for that city.
The city is then logged for future viewing.
If the user wishes to remove the city from their search all they have to do is *click* the orange "clear" button.
